\subsection{Demand}
\paragraph{Definition} The relationship between the price of a product and the quantity people will buy.
\paragraph{Law of Demand} Ceteris paribus, as price increases, the corresponding quantity demanded is going to decrease. Negative correlation.
Ceteris paribus, quantity demanded is a function of price.

\paragraph{Individual vs. Market Demand} INSERT FIGURE 3-2
\paragraph{Changes in Quantity Demanded} Quantity demanded changes because price changes. Graphically, it is a movement along a fixed demand curve caused by only a change in price. INSERT HANDMADE GRAPH
\paragraph{Determinants of Demand}
\begin{enumerate}[label = \textbullet]
	\item Consumer Tastes/Preferences
	\item Number of Buyers (positive correlation)
	\item Income: normal goods --- demand varies direcly with income; inferior goods --- demand varies inversely with income.
	\item Prices of Related Goods: price of substitute goods (positive correlation), price of complementary goods (negative correlation).
	\item Consumer Expectations: future prices, future availability and future income.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Changes in Demand} Shift of the whole demand curve because of determinants above (except from price).

\subsection{Supply}
\paragraph{Definition} The relationship between the price of a product and the quantity people will sell.
\paragraph{Law of Supply} Ceteris paribus, as price increases, the corresponding quantity supplied will increase. Positive correlation. Ceteris paribus, quantity supplied is a function of price. INSERT SUPPLY CURVE
\paragraph{Individual vs. Market Supply}
Calculated the same as demand.
\paragraph{Changes in Quantity Supplied} Quantity supplied changes because price changes. Graphically, it is a movement along a fixed supply curve caused by only a change in price. INSERT HANDMADE GRAPH
