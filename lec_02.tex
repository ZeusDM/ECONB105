\subsection{Five Fundamental Questions}

\paragraph{What goods and services will be produced?} 

\paragraph{How will the goods and services be produced?} What combination of resources and technologies will be used to produce goods and services? How will the production be organized?

\paragraph{Who will recieve the output?} How should total output of goods be shared? Suggestions: based on need; based on contribution to product.

\paragraph{How will the system adapt to change?} Can the economic system change fast enough to remain efficient? This implies a reallocation of resources, since consumer taste, resources and technology changes.

\paragraph{How will the system promote progress?} How do we get output increase? How to get economic growth? This means the standard of living goes up. Technological improvements and capital accumulation will promote this.

\paragraph{Industrial Advanced Economies}

\paragraph{Mixed Systems} Fall between Communism and Pure Capitalism. Examples:

\begin{enumerate}[label = \textbullet]

	\item \textbf{Authoritarian Capitalism, e.g. Nazi Germany} \\ Privately owned resources. Heavy government control over the markets.\\[-1ex]

	\item \textbf{Market socialism, e.g. Serbia} \\ There is public ownership of resources, but also a partial free market.\\[-1ex]

	\item \textbf{Traditional/Costumary Economy, e.g. some Middle East countries} \\ Property ownership and government intervention are basted on customs. Religions and cultural values dictate economic activity.
